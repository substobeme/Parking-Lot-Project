# Parking Lot Management Project
This is a simulation of a parking lot management, where my goal was to create a minimalistic portal to perform the basic functions a parking lot managemnt portal should do such as :
- keep a tab on vehicle and it's assigned slot(if available) and generate a ticket
- calculate a fee using entry and exit time of vehicle using a predeterimed hourly rate to be paid by customer
